# Perspectives: Pandas-based library for emotion graphing and semantic search with LMs

## Overview

The Perspectives library offers an easy way to extract perspectives (emotion events with a speaker, emotion, object, and reason) at scale with its [cutting-edge emotion extraction model](https://huggingface.co/helliun/bart-perspectives). It is built on top of the powerful pandas DataFrame functionality, with added support for semantic search. The library introduces several novel methods for text analytics, **perfect for dealing with customer feedback, analyzing semantic trends, or profiling entities within a text.**

## Main Features

1. **Easily extract perspectives from text**: The `get_perspectives()` function allows you to **extract the speaker's identity, emotions, and the object of these emotions**, giving you useful insights about the emotions in your text.

2. **Powerful search capabilities**: You can perform semantic search on the dataset based on **any column or combination of columns** in the dataset (including columns generated from perspective extraction) . The search method leverages the sentence transformer models for semantic search functionality, providing you with outputs that are spot-on.

3. **Improved machine learning models**: The library efficiently interfaces with specialized model `bart-perspectives` for extraction and the mpnet-base model for search.

4. **Structured emotional outcomes**: All outputs are neatly structured in DataFrame format, allowing for easy downstream analysis and visualizations.

## Installation

	pip install perspectives

## Usage

```python
from perspectives import DataFrame

# Load DataFrame
df = DataFrame(texts = [list of sentences]) 

# Get perspectives
df.get_perspectives()

# Semantic search on any combination of columns
df.search(speaker='...', emotion='...')

# Profile
df.graph(speaker='...')
```

## About me

I'm a recent grad of Ohio State University where I did an undergraduate thesis on Synthetic Data Augmentation using LLMs. I've worked as an NLP consultant for a couple awesome startups, and now I'm looking for a role with an inspiring company who is as interested in the untapped potential of LMs as I am!
